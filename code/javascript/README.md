# JavaScript Numberology

I've implemented the Numberology algorithm here in two forms:

- [`numberology-browser.js`](./numberology-browser.js)
- [`numberology-node.js`](./numberology-node.js)

Because I started my programming journey with JavaScript, I decided to write these scripts first, even though I'm currently a little rusty with the language.

## Install / Run

### Browser

To run the [web browser version of the script](./numberology-browser.js), open the included [`index.html`](./index.html) file in any web browser. You will be prompted by the browser for the required input.

### Node.js

To run the [Node.js version of the script](./numberology-node.js), open the `numberology-node.js` file from the command line, like so:

```shell
node numberology-node.js
```

You will be prompted in the command line for your input.
