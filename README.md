This repo contains implementations of basic Numerology in as many programming languages as I can learn.

## Huh?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology):

> Numerology is the study of the numerical value of the letters in words, names and ideas. It is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar divinatory arts.

I don't personally believe in Numerology's paranormal aspects, but the first part of that definition, *the study of the numerical value of the letters in words*, provides a fun little programming challenge.

### The Numerology Table

  1  |  a  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9
 :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  I
  J  |  K  |  L  |  M  |  N  |  O  |  P  |  Q  |  R
  S  |  T  |  U  |  V  |  W  |  X  |  Y  |  Z  |

## Why?

I was learning Python over a weekend recently, and I came up with writing a Numerology algorithm as a fun way to learn some of the basics of the language. It's got some fun and simple arithmetic and language components that are interesting to think about, and interesting to implement within code.

Writing it in Python made me want to do the same in the other languages I knew at the time (JavaScript, C#, and Swift), which then made me want to expand the scope outward. I've found that this simple algorithm is a great way to learn the basic numerical and string based methods of a language. And because we also calculate the *Life Number*, I can use a languages `Date` method too if it has one.
